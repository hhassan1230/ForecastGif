## Background

I wanted to make this App because I felt checking the weather was not funny enough. The development process
was mostly me poking around in the dark as I used javascript in my rails app for the first time ever.

## Features

- Uses Browser Location to find your location.
- Uses Weather Underground API to get accurate weather data.
- Uses a awesome library made by Tim Holman called (http://tholman.com/giflinks/) to show a gif on hover of the weather.

## Usage

Go to forecastgif.herokuapp.com and enjoy!

## Development/Contribution

This app was a one off but if you'd like to colaborate in the future feel free to reachout.

## Future

I would like to make an app similar to this that would support mobile.
